# Paneer-Lang

Paneer-Lang is a fun-made programming language created for learning and experimentation purposes. It is a simple language that allows you to print messages to the console using the `paneer.bol()` function.

## Usage

To run Paneer-Lang code, you need to have PHP installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Amitminer/Paneer-Lang.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd Paneer-Lang
   ```

3. Run the Paneer-Lang interpreter with a Paneer file:

   ```bash
   $ php interpreter.php paneer yourfile.p
   ```

   Replace `yourfile.p` with the name of your Paneer-Lang file.

### Example

Let's create a simple Paneer-Lang file named `hello.p`:

```plaintext
paneer.bol("Hello, Paneer-Lang!");
```

Save the file and run it using the following command:

```bash
$ php interpreter.php paneer hello.p
```

The output will be:

```
Hello, Paneer-Lang!
```

Feel free to experiment with more Paneer-Lang code and explore the possibilities of this fun language!
